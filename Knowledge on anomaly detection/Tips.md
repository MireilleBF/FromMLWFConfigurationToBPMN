# Meta-workflow definition

## Tasks
The tasks in a meta-workflow are expected to be metatasks, i.e. they represent a family of concrete tasks.
Their name should begin with a verbe and a capital letter e.g. "Preprocess Data"
As soon as the task has already been identified in another metaworkflow, make sure to keep the same name.
If the name are different, they will be considered as two different tasks.
